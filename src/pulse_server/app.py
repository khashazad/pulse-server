"""FastAPI application entry point and ASGI wiring.

Constructs the ``app`` instance: registers the lifespan that initializes the
SQLAlchemy pool, bootstraps schema, and owns the USDA client; installs the
session-auth and user-key guardrail middlewares (with MCP path exemptions);
mounts every feature router; and grafts the FastMCP server plus its OAuth
metadata routes at ``/mcp``.

This module is the composition root of the backend — uvicorn imports ``app``
from here and every cross-cutting concern (auth, DB, MCP, USDA) is wired up
in this file.
