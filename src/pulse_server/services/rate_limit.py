"""In-process sliding-window rate limiting.

Provides :class:`SlidingWindowRateLimiter`, a dependency-free, per-key request
limiter used to throttle abuse of expensive endpoints (e.g. the authenticated
USDA proxy) without an external store. State lives in the worker process, which
is sufficient for the single-process deployment; a multi-worker deployment that
needs a shared limit should move this to Redis.
