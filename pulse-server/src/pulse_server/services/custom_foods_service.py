Provides :func:`upsert_custom_food_and_remember`, which couples a custom-food
upsert with a corresponding ``food_memory`` pointer so that the next time the
user mentions the same name it resolves directly to this custom food. The
function composes :class:`CustomFoodsRepository` and
:class:`FoodMemoryRepository` and assumes the caller controls the transaction
